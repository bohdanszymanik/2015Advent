Sample code for F# Advent post. Demo.fsx holds the code, sampleBatches.txt holds some sample data. 

Use Paket to get the dependencies right. If you've not used paket.exe before it's a two step process:
1. From a cmd prompt in the project directory do ".paket\paket.bootstrapper.exe" . This downloads the latest version of paket.exe.
2. Do ".paket\paket.exe install" . This figures out and downloads all the dependencies.
